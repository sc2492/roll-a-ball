## Roll-a-Ball
### Intro
I built the Roll-a-Ball game in Unity for a VR class project! This was an exercise in creating 3D virtual environments a user can interact with. I don't come from a background in programming, but I learned a thing or two about creating custom scripts with C# and using code to build a basic user interface. This was also a good opportunity for me to brush up on good version control habits in GitHub and markdown syntax I learned from an intro web design class.
### Instructions
The objective is to collect all the floating cubes by running into them with the ball. Time is not your enemy here, but you're welcome to challenge yourself if you'd like. Please download the "Builds" folder and run the .exe file to play (it's for Windows/PC only, I believe). The controls are WASD.
### Notes
I'm a complete newbie to the programming world, so I apologize if my file organization or packaging is hard to follow. I'm doing my best to learn on my own as a designer!
Thanks for stopping by! Hope this was fun.
