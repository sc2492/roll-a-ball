## Roll-a-Ball
<p>I built the Roll-a-Ball game in Unity for a VR class project! I don't come from a background in programming, but I learned a thing or two about creating custom scripts with C# and using code to build a basic user interface. This was also a good opportunity for me to brush up on good version control habits in GitHub and markdown syntax I learned from an intro web design class.</p>
<p>I'm a complete newbie to the programming world, so I apologize if my file organization or packaging is hard to follow. I'm doing my best to learn on my own as a designer! Please download the "Builds" folder and run the exe file to play my game (it's for Windows/PC only, I believe). The controls are WASD.</p>
<p>Thanks for stopping by! Hope this was fun.</p>
